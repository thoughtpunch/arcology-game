## Codebase Patterns

(Add patterns discovered during development here. Future iterations will read this first.)

- Use Vector3i for grid positions (x, y = horizontal, z = floor level)
- All block types defined in data/blocks.json, not hardcoded
- Sprites go in assets/sprites/blocks/{category}/
- Signals over polling: blocks emit signals, systems connect to them
- Balance numbers loaded from data/balance.json at runtime
