## Codebase Patterns

(Add patterns discovered during development here. Future iterations will read this first.)

- Use Vector3i for grid positions (x, y = horizontal, z = floor level)
- All block types defined in data/blocks.json, not hardcoded
- Sprites go in assets/sprites/blocks/{category}/
- Signals over polling: blocks emit signals, systems connect to them
- Balance numbers loaded from data/balance.json at runtime

## Iteration Log

(Ralph will append learnings after each iteration below)

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-25
Task: arcology-4ct.1 - Create Godot 4 project structure
Status: PASSED
Changes:
- project.godot: Godot 4.3 config with input mappings
- scenes/main.tscn: Entry scene with Camera2D, World, UI
- src/core/main.gd: Camera pan/zoom controls
Learnings:
- Godot 4 uses config_version=5
- Camera2D zoom needs matching Vector2 components

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-25
Task: arcology-4ct.2 - Add placeholder sprite
Status: PASSED
Changes:
- assets/sprites/blocks/placeholder.svg: 64x32 isometric diamond
- scenes/main.tscn: Added PlaceholderSprite node
Learnings:
- SVG works well for placeholder sprites in Godot 4
