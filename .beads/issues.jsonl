{"id":"arcology-0ru","title":"Epic: Undo/Redo \u0026 Command Pattern — Reversible actions for 3D block placement","description":"## Problem\n\n3D building is inherently error-prone. Depth perception is harder than 2D — players WILL misplace blocks inside dense structures where the wrong block is buried behind walls. Without undo, the only recourse is right-clicking to hunt for and delete the mistake, which may be invisible without cutaway mode.\n\nEvery successful building game (Minecraft, Cities Skylines, The Sims, Factorio) has undo or trivial deletion. In a game where structures are complex and enclosed, undo is the difference between \"fun to build\" and \"rage quit.\"\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Command Pattern Architecture\n- Every mutating action becomes a Command object with execute() and undo()\n- Command types needed:\n  - PlaceBlockCommand(definition, origin, rotation) → stores block_id for undo\n  - RemoveBlockCommand(block_id) → stores full block state for redo\n  - RotateBlockCommand (if rotation becomes post-placement)\n  - ExcavateCommand(grid_pos) → stores strata type for undo\n  - FillAreaCommand(definition, cells) → stores all placed block_ids\n  - PasteCommand(blueprint, origin) → stores all placed block_ids\n  - (Future) MoveBlockCommand, ChangePanelCommand, etc.\n- Command stack with configurable max depth (100? 500?)\n- Redo stack (cleared on new action, standard behavior)\n\n### Multi-Block Undo\n- Area fill places 25 blocks — undo should reverse ALL 25 in one step\n- Corridor drag-to-build places N segments — undo reverses entire path\n- Need concept of \"compound commands\" that group sub-commands\n\n### Structural Integrity on Undo\n- Removing a block via undo might leave blocks above unsupported\n- Options: (a) undo always succeeds, structural check is advisory, (b) undo refuses if it would create structural violation, (c) undo cascades — removes the undone block AND anything it was supporting\n- This is a design decision with gameplay implications\n\n### UX\n- Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z (standard keybinds)\n- Visual feedback: briefly highlight what was undone/redone\n- Undo history panel? (show last N actions, click to undo to that point)\n- How many undos to support? (Memory vs. convenience)\n\n### Interaction with Save/Load\n- Does saving clear the undo stack?\n- Does loading restore an undo stack?\n- Should undo history be part of the save file?\n\n### Interaction with Game Simulation\n- In sandbox/build mode (Phase 0): undo is straightforward, no simulation running\n- In live game (Milestone 6+): undoing a block placement while simulation is ticking — does time rewind? Or just geometry reverts? (Probably just geometry — you can't un-simulate agent behavior)\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should undo be limited to building actions, or also cover camera movements, UI state?\n2. Maximum undo depth — memory implications for 500 undos of 25-block fill operations?\n3. Should undo work across save/load boundaries?\n4. How does undo interact with multiplayer (if ever)?\n5. Should there be a \"revert to last save\" as a nuclear undo option?\n6. Can compound commands be partially undone? (Undo 3 of the 25 blocks in a fill?)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be designed before multi-block operations (area fill, paste)\n- Command pattern affects how placement code is structured — worth implementing early\n- Current placement in sandbox_main.gd is direct mutation, would need refactoring\n\n## Implementation Sketch\n```gdscript\nclass_name Command extends RefCounted\nfunc execute() -\u003e bool: return false  # override\nfunc undo() -\u003e bool: return false     # override\nfunc description() -\u003e String: return \"\" # for UI\n\nclass_name CommandStack extends Node\nvar undo_stack: Array[Command] = []\nvar redo_stack: Array[Command] = []\nconst MAX_UNDO = 200\n\nfunc do(cmd: Command) -\u003e bool:\n    if cmd.execute():\n        undo_stack.append(cmd)\n        redo_stack.clear()\n        if undo_stack.size() \u003e MAX_UNDO:\n            undo_stack.pop_front()\n        return true\n    return false\n```","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:38:59.313361-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:38:59.313361-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}

{"id":"arcology-3s2","title":"Epic: Multi-Block Operations — Area fill, region delete, copy/paste/blueprints","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently placement is one block at a time. A player building a 100-floor arcology needs to lay out hundreds of identical residential floors, long corridor runs, repeated infrastructure patterns. Without bulk operations, building at scale is so tedious that players won't reach the interesting simulation parts — they'll burn out on manual block-by-block placement.\n\nEvery successful building game solves this: Minecraft has fill commands and WorldEdit, Cities Skylines has zoning brushes, Factorio has blueprints and copy/paste, The Sims has room duplication.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Area Fill\n- Select block type → drag a 3D box (start corner to end corner) → fill entire volume\n- 2D variant: drag a 2D rectangle on a single floor → fill that floor area\n- Works with any block type, respects rotation\n- Preview shows ghost of entire fill before confirming\n- Validation: all cells must be buildable, show count of blocks to be placed\n- Consider: should fill skip occupied cells (fill around existing blocks) or require empty volume?\n\n### Region Delete\n- Select a 3D box → delete all blocks within it\n- Or: \"delete floor\" — remove all blocks at a given Y level\n- Structural integrity warning: \"Deleting these blocks will leave 47 blocks unsupported. Proceed?\"\n- Cascading delete option: \"Delete these AND everything they support\"\n- Preview: highlight blocks that will be deleted in red before confirming\n\n### Copy/Paste\n- Select region (3D box) → copy to clipboard\n- Paste at new location with ghost preview\n- Rotation of pasted region (0/90/180/270)\n- Mirror option (flip east-west or north-south)\n- Paste respects validation — shows which blocks can/can't place in new location\n- What gets copied? Block types + rotations + relative positions. NOT simulation state.\n\n### Blueprints\n- Save a copied region as a named blueprint\n- Blueprint library accessible from build menu\n- Pre-built blueprints: \"standard residential floor\", \"elevator core\", \"corridor ring\"\n- Player-created blueprints saved with game\n- Share blueprints between save files? Export/import?\n\n### Repeat/Pattern Tools\n- \"Repeat upward\" — copy current floor and stack N times above\n- \"Repeat along axis\" — copy a section and repeat it along X or Z\n- This is the killer feature for arcology-scale building: design one floor, repeat it 50 times\n\n### Interaction with Undo\n- Area fill (25 blocks) → Ctrl+Z should undo ALL 25 as one operation\n- Compound command pattern (see Undo/Redo epic)\n- Same for region delete: undoing a delete restores all removed blocks\n\n### Interaction with Structural Integrity\n- Pasting a section in mid-air — reject if no support, or allow with warning?\n- Area fill at Y=5 with nothing below — require column support first?\n- Should there be a \"scaffolding\" mode that temporarily ignores structural rules?\n\n### Selection as Foundation\n- All multi-block operations require a selection system first\n- Box selection: click-drag to define 3D region\n- How to define a 3D box with a 2D mouse? Options:\n  - Click two corners (one for XZ, one for Y)\n  - Click floor plane for XZ, then scroll/drag for Y height\n  - Click start corner, drag to end corner on same floor, then Shift+scroll to extend vertically\n- Selection ticket exists (arcology-d4g) but is P2 — should this be elevated?\n\n## Open Questions\n1. What's the minimum viable version? (Probably: area fill on one floor + undo)\n2. Should blueprints include block TYPE info only, or also panel/material preferences?\n3. How do multi-cell blocks interact with area fill? (A 3x1x1 beam doesn't tile neatly into a 5x5 area)\n4. Should there be a \"stamp\" mode? (Click repeatedly to paste blueprint at cursor)\n5. Cost implications — filling 100 blocks at once should cost 100x, shown before confirming\n6.

InputHandler receives mouse events properly\n2. _try_place_block() successfully creates and places blocks\n3. Grid block count increases after placement (11 → 12 in test)\n4. Placement signals fire correctly (\"Placed corridor at ...\")\n\n### Changes Made\n- Added mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE to DebugLabel in main.tscn\n- This ensures the debug label doesn't capture mouse clicks\n\n### Possible Causes of Original Bug\n1. DebugLabel was capturing clicks in top-left area (now fixed)\n2. Visual feedback issue - blocks placed but not rendered properly\n3. User clicking on HUD panels (expected behavior - UI should capture those)\n4. Bug was already fixed in a previous commit\n\n### Test Coverage\n- Created test_input_events.gd to verify InputHandler receives events\n- Verified block count increases after simulated click\n- Confirmed _is_ready() returns true in running game\n\n### Files Checked\n- src/core/input_handler.gd - Input handling logic works correctly\n- src/core/block_renderer.gd - Texture loading may fail in headless mode\n- src/ui/hud.gd - Mouse filters set correctly for viewport pass-through\n- scenes/main.tscn - Fixed DebugLabel mouse filter","created_at":"2026-01-26T03:54:25Z"},{"id":67,"issue_id":"arcology-edz","author":"danielbarrett","text":"## Fix Applied\n\n**Fixed:** 2026-01-25\n\n### Root Cause\nThe legacy BlockPicker UI (full-width panel at bottom 60px) and FloorSelector UI (top-left corner) were overlapping with the new HUD and potentially capturing mouse events. The BlockPicker especially spanned the full width at the bottom, potentially interfering with mouse passthrough.\n\n### Changes Made\n1. `src/ui/block_picker.gd`:\n   - Set `visible = false` to hide legacy visual UI\n   - Set `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE`\n   - Removed PanelContainer (was capturing mouse)\n   - Kept button container for internal state tracking\n   - Keyboard shortcuts (1-6) still work\n\n2. `src/ui/floor_selector.gd`:\n   - Set `visible = false` to hide legacy visual UI\n   - Set `mouse_filter = MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE`\n   - Removed PanelContainer\n   - Keyboard shortcuts (PageUp/PageDown) still work\n\n3. `src/ui/hud.gd`:\n   - Changed `set_anchors_preset` to `set_anchors_and_offsets_preset` for proper full-screen sizing\n\n### Result\nLegacy UI is now invisible but keyboard functionality preserved. The new HUD provides the visual interface while legacy controls handle input until HUD buttons are wired up.\n\n### Test Coverage\n- test_block_picker.gd: 4 tests pass\n- test_floor_selector.gd: 3 tests pass\n- test_hud.gd: 62 tests pass","created_at":"2026-01-26T03:58:06Z"}]}

{"id":"arcology-itx.6","title":"Add elevator shaft block type","description":"# Add Elevator Shaft Block Type\n\n## Overview\nElevator shafts are vertical connectors that span multiple floors. Unlike stairs (which connect only ±1 floor), elevator shafts connect ALL floors they occupy, enabling fast vertical transit across the entire structure.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Add `elevator_shaft` block type to `data/blocks.json`\n2. Vertical stack of elevator shafts connects all floors it spans\n3. Update connectivity algorithm to traverse through elevator shafts\n4. Visual sprite distinguishes elevators from other blocks\n\n## Block Definition\n```json\n{\n  \"elevator_shaft\": {\n    \"name\": \"Elevator Shaft\",\n    \"size\": [1, 1, 1],\n    \"cost\": 500,\n    \"category\": \"transit\",\n    \"traversable\": true,\n    \"connects_vertical\": true,\n    \"vertical_range\": 10,\n    \"sprite\": \"res://assets/sprites/blocks/elevator.png\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Connection Logic\nFrom `milestone-3-connectivity.md`:\n```gdscript\nfunc connects_vertical(direction: int) -\u003e bool:\n    match block_type:\n        \"elevator_shaft\":\n            return true  # Connects up and down\n        _:\n            return false\n```\n\n## How It Works\n1. Elevator shaft at (x, y, z) connects to elevator shaft at (x, y, z±1)\n2. A vertical stack of elevator shafts creates a continuous connection\n3. All floors spanned by the elevator stack are connected\n4. Must stack elevator shafts vertically to create working elevator\n\n## Building Pattern\n```\nFloor 5: [elevator_shaft] ← connected\nFloor 4: [elevator_shaft] ← connected\nFloor 3: [elevator_shaft] ← connected\nFloor 2: (empty)          ← NOT connected (gap breaks elevator)\nFloor 1: [elevator_shaft] ← connected only to floor 0\nFloor 0: [entrance]       ← start\n```\n\n## 📚 Required Reading\n- `documentation/architecture/milestones/milestone-3-connectivity.md` - Connection rules, code samples\n- `documentation/game-design/blocks/README.md` - Block catalog\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\nFrom milestone-3-connectivity.md:\n- [ ] `elevator_shaft` block type exists in blocks.json\n- [ ] Elevator shafts connect all floors they span\n- [ ] Connectivity flood-fill traverses through elevator shaft stack\n- [ ] Gap in elevator stack breaks vertical connection\n- [ ] Elevator sprite visually distinct from stairs","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-25T14:57:56.997959-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-25T20:00:24.461734-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-25T20:00:24.461734-06:00","close_reason":"Already implemented: elevator_shaft block type exists in blocks.json with sprite and vertical connectivity is tested in test_connectivity_integration.gd","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"arcology-itx.6","depends_on_id":"arcology-itx","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-25T14:57:57.002436-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett"},{"issue_id":"arcology-itx.6","depends_on_id":"arcology-itx.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-25T17:43:12.867468-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett"}],"comments":[{"id":13,"issue_id":"arcology-itx.6","author":"danielbarrett","text":"# Elevator Shaft Block Type\n\n## User Stories (from PRD Section 6.5, 19.8, Appendix A.2)\n- US-6.5: As a player, I want elevators for efficient vertical transit.\n- PRD: \"Elevator (Local): Range ±10 floors, Speed 3.0x, Capacity Medium, Power 10 units/floor\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Block Definition in blocks.json\n```json\n{\n  \"elevator_shaft\": {\n    \"id\": \"elevator_shaft\",\n    \"name\": \"Elevator Shaft\",\n    \"category\": \"transit\",\n    \"size\": [1, 1, 1],\n    \"traversability\": \"PUBLIC\",\n    \"vertical_connection\": {\n      \"type\": \"elevator\",\n      \"connects_all_in_stack\": true,\n      \"speed_multiplier\": 3.0,\n      \"power_per_floor\": 10\n    },\n    \"sprites\": {\n      \"base\": \"elevator_shaft.svg\"\n    },\n    \"placement_rules\": {\n      \"must_stack_vertically\": true\n    },\n    \"description\": \"Vertical transit shaft - stack multiple to connect floors\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Elevator Stack Model (M3 Scope)\n1. **Vertical stack:** Multiple elevator_shaft blocks stacked on same (x, y)\n2. **All connected:** Every floor in the stack connects to every other floor\n3. **No cars/wait time yet:** Abstract as \"teleport within stack\"\n\n### Connectivity Integration\n```gdscript\n# Elevator shaft creates connections to ALL blocks in its vertical stack\nfunc get_elevator_stack(pos: Vector3i) -\u003e Array[Vector3i]:\n    var stack = []\n    var x = pos.x\n    var y = pos.y\n    \n    # Scan up and down for continuous elevator_shaft blocks\n    # Up\n    var z = pos.z\n    while true:\n        var check = Vector3i(x, y, z)\n        var block = get_block_at(check)\n        if block and block.type == \"elevator_shaft\":\n            stack.append(check)\n            z += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    # Down\n    z = pos.z - 1\n    while z \u003e= min_z:\n        var check = Vector3i(x, y, z)\n        var block = get_block_at(check)\n        if block and block.type == \"elevator_shaft\":\n            stack.append(check)\n            z -= 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    return stack\n```\n\n### Connectivity Rules\n- All positions in elevator stack are mutually connected\n- Must have horizontal neighbor (corridor) at entry/exit floors\n- BFS treats elevator stack as fully connected subgraph\n\n### Placement Rules\n1. **Stack requirement:** Should stack with existing elevator_shaft OR start new stack\n2. **Horizontal access:** At least top or bottom needs adjacent corridor\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Elevator shaft defined in blocks.json\n- [ ] Stacked shafts connect all floors they span\n- [ ] Connectivity BFS can traverse elevator stacks\n- [ ] Sprite created (64x32 isometric elevator doors)\n- [ ] Can place elevator and reach upper floors\n\n## Sprite Notes\n- Show elevator doors (closed)\n- Metallic/industrial look\n- Should visually differ from stairs\n\n## Out of Scope (Later Milestones)\n- Elevator cars and wait time simulation\n- Capacity limits\n- Express elevators (±30 floors)\n- Power consumption\n- Sky Lobbies","created_at":"2026-01-25T21:34:25Z"},{"id":30,"issue_id":"arcology-itx.6","author":"danielbarrett","text":"## 📚 Required Reading\n\n**Before starting this task, you MUST read:**\n1.

{"id":"arcology-ocz","title":"Epic: Audio \u0026 Spatial Sound Design — Ambient soundscape for a living 3D structure","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently the only audio is a procedural placement click. City builders NEED ambient soundscapes to feel alive — the hum of activity, the quiet of residential floors, the bustle of commercial zones. In a 3D enclosed structure, audio is even more important because the player often CAN'T see what's happening (it's behind walls). Sound becomes a secondary information channel.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Spatial Audio Architecture\n- Camera position determines what the player hears\n- Audio should change as camera moves through the structure:\n  - Exterior: wind, city ambiance, bird sounds, distant traffic\n  - Commercial floor: chatter, clinking, activity bustle\n  - Residential floor: quiet, muffled sounds, occasional doors\n  - Corridor: footsteps, echo, ventilation hum\n  - Elevator shaft: mechanical sounds, whoosh\n  - Underground: muffled, earthy, dripping\n- Transition smoothly between zones as camera moves\n\n### Sound Categories\n1. **Ambient bed**: continuous background based on location (exterior/interior/underground)\n2. **Activity sounds**: triggered by simulation events (residents moving, doors, cooking)\n3. **System sounds**: HVAC hum, elevator motors, power generators, water pipes\n4. **UI sounds**: placement, deletion, menu clicks, notifications, alerts\n5. **Music**: adaptive soundtrack that responds to game state\n6. **Environmental**: weather, time of day (crickets at night, birds at dawn)\n\n### Occupancy-Based Audio\n- Empty building: echo, silence, wind through corridors\n- Populated building: life sounds proportional to density\n- Overcrowded: cacophony, stress sounds\n- Abandoned floor: eerie quiet, creaking\n- This creates emotional feedback without any UI element\n\n### Notification Audio\n- Severity-coded alert sounds (see Notification epic)\n- Not annoying at high frequency\n- Optional spatial positioning (hear the problem's direction)\n\n### Music System\n- Adaptive/generative soundtrack\n- Responds to: time of day, game speed, crisis state, AEI score, building scale\n- Peaceful during building, tense during crises, triumphant at milestones\n- Player can adjust or mute independently\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- Audio processing budget alongside rendering\n- LOD for audio: full spatial audio near camera, simplified ambient for distant\n- Max simultaneous audio sources\n- Streaming vs. preloaded\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should audio be a priority at all during Phase 0/1, or deferred until simulation exists?\n2. Procedural audio (generate sounds) vs. recorded samples vs. hybrid?\n3. How does audio interact with game speed? (Fast forward = pitched up? Compressed? Different track?)\n4. Should there be a \"listen\" mode — pause game, close eyes, hear your arcology?\n5. Accessibility: visual alternatives for all audio cues?\n6. Budget for audio assets vs. procedural generation?\n\n## Dependencies\n- Agent simulation (milestone 7) — drives activity sounds\n- Environment systems — drives system/ambient sounds\n- Notification system (arcology-oag) — drives alert sounds\n- Camera system — determines listener position\n- Basically every system generates sound, so this is a cross-cutting concern\n\n## Reference Games\n- Cities Skylines: excellent spatial audio, changes with zoom level\n- SimCity: iconic music, ambient city sounds\n- Dwarf Fortress: minimal audio, cult following despite it\n- Oxygen Not Included: great ambient audio that conveys system state\n- Minecraft: spatial audio, biome-based ambient, iconic sounds","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:44:28.971961-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:44:28.971961-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}

But the HARD problem isn't implementing each mode — it's designing how they interact with every other system. This is the single most important UX challenge in the game.\n\nThe player is building, inspecting, and managing a structure they cannot see all of at once. Every interaction must be designed with \"but the thing I want to click is behind 4 walls\" in mind.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Visibility Mode × Placement Interaction\n- I'm in cutaway mode at floor 5. I click to place a block. Does it:\n  (a) Place at floor 5 (the cut plane)?\n  (b) Place wherever the ray hits below the cut plane?\n  (c) Place on the cut plane surface as if it were solid ground?\n- Ghost preview during cutaway — does the ghost render above the cut plane? (It should, so you can see what you're building)\n- I'm in x-ray mode and click a transparent exterior wall — do I select the wall, or the block behind it?\n- Floor isolate + placement: can I only place on the isolated floor, or can I still build up/down?\n\n### Visibility Mode × Selection Interaction\n- Click to select a block that's behind walls — does the game auto-activate cutaway/x-ray?\n- In x-ray mode, clicking should prioritize interior blocks over transparent exteriors\n- Box selection in 3D — does the selection box respect the current visibility mode? (Only select visible blocks? Or all blocks in the 3D volume?)\n- How do you select a block that's completely enclosed? (No exposed face to click)\n\n### Visibility Mode Transitions\n- Switching between modes should be seamless, not jarring\n- Camera position should be preserved across mode switches\n- What's the default mode? (Normal → cutaway is probably the most common transition)\n- Should modes be stackable? (Cutaway + x-ray simultaneously?)\n- Quick-toggle: press and hold C for temporary cutaway, release to return?\n\n### The \"Enclosed Block\" Problem\n- Player builds a solid 5x5x5 cube. The center block (2,2,2) is completely enclosed — no face is visible in any mode.\n- How do you: select it? Delete it? Inspect it? Replace it?\n- Options: section mode (vertical slice), x-ray mode (see through), floor isolate (horizontal slice), or \"peel\" tool (strip layers)\n- This WILL happen — players will enclose blocks accidentally and intentionally\n\n### Ghost Preview Depth Cues\n- When placing blocks deep inside a structure, how does the player judge depth?\n- Ghost preview needs strong depth cues: outline, shadow, depth-based transparency\n- Face labels on ghost (currently showing face + rotation) help — but are they enough?\n- Consider: \"depth indicator\" showing how far the ghost is from the camera in grid units\n\n### Notification → Visibility Mode Chain\n- Player gets notification: \"Block on floor 12 has no light\"\n- Click notification → camera flies to floor 12 → cutaway activates at floor 13 → problem block highlights\n- This chain (notification → camera move → visibility mode → highlight) needs to feel automatic and smooth\n- What if the problem is underground? Camera needs to transition smoothly to below-grade views\n\n### Information at Different Visibility Levels\n- Normal mode: exterior only, show aggregate health indicators on surface\n- Cutaway: show floor interior, individual block status\n- X-ray: show structure + activity simultaneously, block types as colored volumes\n- Isolate: detailed single-floor view, room-level information\n- Section: architectural cross-section, useful for understanding vertical systems (elevator shafts, light pipes)\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should there be a dedicated \"inspection mode\" vs \"build mode\"? (The Sims: Live mode vs Build mode)\n2. Can visibility modes be assigned per-region? (\"Always show the lobby in cutaway\")\n3. Should cutaway height track the camera tilt? (Tilt down → cut plane lowers automatically)\n4. How do overlays (light, noise, safety heat maps) render in each visibility mode?\n5. Is there a \"focus mode\" — click a block, and everything else dims/fades except that block and its immediate context?\n6. Should the scroll wheel adjust cut-plane height when in cutaway mode, instead of zoom?\n7. How do multi-cell blocks render when the cut plane bisects them? (Cut through a 3x2 wall — show the cross-section?)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Visibility modes implementation (arcology-5e2.9, arcology-9qx)\n- Selection system (arcology-d4g)\n- Notification system (not yet designed)\n- Ghost preview system (exists in Phase 0, needs extension)\n- Overlay system (milestone 10)\n- Wayfinding epic (arcology-s6b) — heavy overlap on navigation-driven visibility\n\n## Why This Is the Hardest Problem\nIn a 2D game, you can see everything. The design challenge is information density.\nIn a 3D game with OPEN structures (Cities Skylines), you can see most things. The challenge is camera control.\nIn a 3D game with ENCLOSED structures (Arcology), you can see almost NOTHING without tools. The challenge is making the invisible visible without overwhelming the player.\n\nEvery feature in the game — placement, management, simulation inspection — flows through this problem. Get it right and the game is magical. Get it wrong and it's unplayable.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:41:18.888192-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:41:18.888192-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}

{"id":"arcology-s6b","title":"Epic: Player Wayfinding \u0026 Navigation — Finding things inside a 3D enclosed structure","description":"## Problem\n\nIn Cities Skylines, you look DOWN at a flat plane — everything is visible. In Arcology, you're building a structure players look INTO. Once the arcology hits 10+ floors with enclosed corridors and stacked residential blocks, the player's #1 question becomes: \"Where is the thing I'm looking for?\"\n\nThis is a design problem unique to 3D enclosed structures. Visibility modes (cutaway, x-ray) help you SEE, but wayfinding helps you FIND. No docs currently address this.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### The Core Problem\nA player built a 30-floor arcology with 5,000 blocks. They get a notification: \"Restaurant on floor 12 has no customers.\" How do they:\n1. Find that restaurant?\n2. Navigate the camera to it?\n3. Understand WHY it has no customers (is it disconnected? no corridor access? too far from residential?)\n4. Return to what they were doing before?\n\n### Wayfinding Tools to Consider\n\n**Floor Index / Directory**\n- Sidebar showing floor-by-floor breakdown\n- Click a floor → camera jumps to floor-isolate view\n- Shows block type counts per floor (12 residential, 3 commercial, 1 corridor...)\n- Collapsible tree: Floor 12 → Restaurant \"Block #847\" → click to focus\n\n**Search / Find**\n- Search box: type \"restaurant\" → highlights all restaurants in the structure\n- Filter by: block type, status (occupied/vacant), problems (no access, no light)\n- Results show as a list AND as highlighted blocks in the 3D view\n- Click result → camera flies to that block\n\n**Minimap / Cross-Section**\n- Small window showing a 2D cross-section of the arcology at current camera height\n- Or: a small top-down floor plan of the current floor\n- Player's camera position shown as indicator\n- Click minimap to move camera\n\n**Bookmarks / Pins**\n- Player pins locations: \"Main lobby\", \"Problem area\", \"Expansion zone\"\n- Hotkey to cycle between bookmarks\n- Persistent across sessions (saved with game)\n- Camera bookmark tickets exist (arcology-5xn) but this is broader — location + context, not just camera angle\n\n**Breadcrumb Trail / Camera History**\n- Camera history exists (Backspace in orbital_camera.gd) — this is good\n- Extend to: \"go back to where I was before I clicked that notification\"\n- Stack-based: notification pulls camera → player investigates → press Back → return to previous position\n\n**Notification-Driven Navigation**\n- When a problem occurs, notification appears in feed\n- Click notification → camera flies to the problem location, cutaway mode activates if needed\n- \"Next problem\" / \"Previous problem\" cycling\n- Problem markers visible in 3D space (floating icons above problem blocks)\n\n**Overlay-Based Discovery**\n- \"Show me all blocks with light \u003c 50%\" → heat map overlay activates, camera enters overview mode\n- \"Show me disconnected blocks\" → disconnected blocks pulse red\n- \"Show me where residents are unhappy\" → satisfaction heat map\n- These exist conceptually in milestone 10 (overlays) but the NAVIGATION aspect — \"overlay as wayfinding tool\" — isn't designed\n\n### Information Density at Different Scales\n- Zoomed in (1-5 blocks): show block details, resident names, real-time activity\n- Mid zoom (floor level): show block types as colored cubes, aggregate stats\n- Zoomed out (whole arcology): show system health as heat map, floor labels, problem indicators\n- The information shown should change with zoom level — too much detail at overview scale is noise\n\n## Open Questions\n1. What's the primary wayfinding metaphor — floor plans (architectural), search (database), or spatial (minimap)?\n2. Should the game have a \"schematic view\" — an abstract 2D floor plan mode for management?\n3. How do wayfinding tools interact with visibility modes? (e.g., search highlights a block that's behind walls — auto-activate cutaway?)\n4. Should blocks have player-assignable names/labels? (\"My favorite restaurant\", \"Problem zone\")\n5. Is a minimap worth the screen real estate, or is the View Cube enough?\n6. How do notifications route attention without being annoying? (Dwarf Fortress problem)\n7. At what arcology size does wayfinding become critical? (probably 500+ blocks / 10+ floors)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Visibility modes (cutaway/x-ray) must work first — wayfinding tools will activate them automatically\n- Notification system (not yet designed) feeds into navigation\n- Overlay system (milestone 10) overlaps significantly\n- Camera bookmark system (arcology-5xn) is a small piece of this\n- Search/filter requires block metadata to be queryable\n\n## Reference Games\n- Dwarf Fortress: z-level navigation, designation overlays, announcements → zoom-to-location\n- RimWorld: architect categories, zone overlays, alert system\n- SimTower: floor selector sidebar, elevator visualization\n- The Sims: room-by-room camera, live mode vs build mode\n- Oxygen Not Included: overlay system as primary navigation tool","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:40:28.511384-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:40:28.511384-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}

{"id":"arcology-tlj","title":"Epic: Notification \u0026 Attention Routing — Surfacing problems inside an enclosed 3D structure","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen a crisis happens deep inside a 50-floor structure — a power failure on floor 23, a fight in the food hall, a backed-up elevator — how does the player know? You can't flash a tile red when it's behind 4 walls on a floor the player isn't looking at.\n\nIn 2D city builders, problems are visually obvious (burning building, traffic jam visible from above). In a 3D enclosed structure, problems are invisible by default. The notification system IS the management interface.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Notification Types \u0026 Severity\n- **Critical** (immediate attention): structural failure, fire, riot, mass exodus\n- **Warning** (check when convenient): overcrowding, light deprivation, rising crime\n- **Info** (FYI): new resident moved in, business opened, milestone reached\n- **Opportunity** (positive): \"Floor 15 residents are especially happy — what's working there?\"\n\n### Notification Feed\n- Scrolling feed (like Dwarf Fortress announcements or Cities Skylines chirper)\n- Filterable by type, severity, floor, system\n- Grouped: \"12 residents on floor 8 complain about noise\" (not 12 separate notifications)\n- Aging: old notifications fade, resolved ones auto-dismiss\n- Rate limiting: prevent notification spam during cascading failures\n\n### Click-to-Navigate\n- Click any notification → camera flies to the relevant location\n- Automatic visibility mode activation:\n  - Problem on floor 12 → cutaway at floor 13\n  - Problem underground → camera descends, ground becomes transparent\n  - Transit issue → highlight the affected corridor path\n- Highlight pulse on the problem block/area\n- \"Back\" button to return to previous camera position after investigating\n\n### Persistent Problem Markers\n- Unresolved problems get 3D markers floating above the problem location\n- Visible through walls (like quest markers in RPGs, but subtle)\n- Color-coded by severity\n- Dismissable individually or by type\n- Toggle visibility of markers (might be distracting during building)\n\n### Alert Sounds\n- Severity-appropriate audio cues\n- Not annoying at high frequency (Dwarf Fortress problem: constant alerts = player mutes them)\n- Spatial audio option: hear problems that are near the camera louder than distant ones?\n\n### System Health Dashboard\n- Aggregate view: \"Power: 78%, Water: 92%, Transit: 45% (WARNING), Safety: 88%\"\n- Click a system → overlay activates showing that system's status across the arcology\n- Trend indicators: \"Transit capacity declining over last 5 minutes\"\n- This is the large-scale management interface (see Scale Transition epic)\n\n### Notification × Simulation Interaction\n- Which simulation events generate notifications?\n- Threshold-based: \"notify when any floor drops below 50% light\"\n- Player-configurable thresholds? (\"I don't care about noise complaints under 60dB\")\n- Cooldown per issue: don't re-notify about the same problem every tick\n\n## Open Questions\n1. How prominent should notifications be? (Subtle feed vs. modal popups for critical?)\n2. Should the player be able to set up \"watches\" on specific blocks/floors/systems?\n3. Do notifications pause the game? (Critical ones might warrant a pause + camera move)\n4. Is there an advisor character who contextualizes notifications?

{"id":"arcology-vzg","title":"Epic: Save/Load \u0026 Persistence — Data model serialization, save format, autosave","description":"## Problem\n\nThere are zero tickets for persistence anywhere in the backlog. Data model decisions being made NOW (how blocks, grid state, scenario config, cell occupancy are stored) directly affect save format. Retrofitting serialization onto a data model designed without it is painful and bug-prone.\n\nEven Phase 0 benefits from \"save this build, reload it later\" — without it, every test session starts from scratch.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### Data Model Serialization\n- How are placed blocks serialized? (block_id, definition_id, origin Vector3i, rotation, occupied_cells)\n- How is grid state stored? (cell_occupancy dictionary, ground strata state, excavation state)\n- How is scenario config persisted? (50+ parameters from ScenarioConfig)\n- What's the format? (JSON? Godot Resource? Binary? Compressed?)\n- How do multi-cell blocks serialize? (store origin + definition, or every cell?)\n\n### Save File Format\n- Version header for migration compatibility\n- What metadata goes in the save? (timestamp, playtime, scenario name, block count, screenshot thumbnail?)\n- File size targets for large arcologies (50k+ blocks)\n- Compression strategy\n\n### Save/Load UX\n- Manual save slots vs. named saves\n- Autosave interval and slot rotation\n- Quick-save / quick-load keybinds\n- Save file browser with thumbnails\n- \"Are you sure?\" confirmation on overwrite\n\n### Migration Strategy\n- How do save files survive game updates?\n- Version field in save format from day one\n- Migration functions per version bump\n- What breaks saves vs. what's backward-compatible?\n\n### Edge Cases\n- Saving during simulation tick — snapshot consistency\n- Very large saves (200k blocks) — async save to avoid frame stutter\n- Corrupt save recovery\n- Cloud save considerations (future)\n\n## Open Questions\n1. Should Phase 0 sandbox have save/load, or wait for the \"real\" game scene?\n2. JSON (human-readable, debuggable) vs binary (compact, fast) vs Godot .tres/.res?\n3. Should save files include undo history?\n4. How does save format interact with scenario config — is the scenario embedded or referenced?\n5. Should there be an export format for sharing builds (stripped-down, no simulation state)?\n\n## Dependencies\n- Affects every system that stores state: grid, blocks, agents, economy, environment\n- Should be designed before Milestone 5 (Economy) adds mutable game state beyond blocks\n- ScenarioConfig (arcology-3kj) should be designed with serialization in mind\n\n## Reference\n- Current data structures: src/phase0/sandbox_main.gd (cell_occupancy, placed_blocks dictionaries)\n- Current block data: src/phase0/block_definition.gd, placed_block.gd\n- Scenario config: src/phase0/scenario_config.gd","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:38:31.079697-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:38:31.079697-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}

Dwarf Fortress... doesn't solve it, and that's partly why it's famously overwhelming.\n\nArcology's unique challenge: the structure is VERTICAL and ENCLOSED, so scale problems compound — more floors = harder to see, harder to navigate, harder to manage.\n\n## What Needs Design\n\n### The Scale Spectrum\n\n**Tiny (1-50 blocks, \u003c100 residents)**\n- Player mindset: architect, experimenting\n- Placing individual blocks, learning mechanics\n- No systems pressure — survival needs trivially met\n- Camera: close zoom, inspecting individual blocks\n- Tools needed: basic palette, placement, removal\n\n**Small (50-500 blocks, 100-1,000 residents)**\n- Player mindset: builder, creating a vision\n- First corridors, first elevator, first commercial block\n- Light and air start mattering (interior blocks get dark)\n- First resident complaints appear\n- Tools needed: visibility modes (cutaway becomes essential), basic overlays\n\n**Medium (500-5,000 blocks, 1,000-10,000 residents)**\n- Player mindset: planner, balancing systems\n- Economy matters — rent income vs. infrastructure cost\n- Transit congestion (corridors too narrow, elevator wait times)\n- Social dynamics emerge (neighborhoods, status stratification)\n- Tools needed: area fill, floor repeat, search/filter, notification system\n- Performance: chunk system becomes necessary\n\n**Large (5,000-50,000 blocks, 10,000-100,000 residents)**\n- Player mindset: mayor, managing crises\n- Individual blocks are noise — thinking in floors/zones/districts\n- Entropy is a real threat (maintenance costs, decay)\n- Political dynamics (NIMBYism, faction conflicts)\n- Tools needed: blueprints, zoning brush, district management, automation\n- Performance: LOD system essential, simulation LOD for distant agents\n\n**Mega (50,000+ blocks, 100,000+ residents)**\n- Player mindset: systems thinker, cultivating emergence\n- Most management is automated or delegated\n- Watching for emergent behavior, nudging systems\n- Eudaimonia score is the primary metric\n- Victory conditions become relevant\n- Tools needed: statistical dashboards, policy levers, macro-level overlays\n\n### Progressive Unlocks\n- What unlocks at each scale tier?\n- New block types? New tools? New overlays? New management UI?\n- Should unlocks be gated by population, block count, height, AEI score, or time?\n- Is it a strict gate (\"you need 1000 residents to unlock X\") or soft (\"X becomes available when useful\")?\n\n### Tool Evolution\n- At 50 blocks: place individual blocks, it's fun\n- At 500 blocks: individual placement is tedious, need area fill\n- At 5000 blocks: area fill is tedious, need floor repeat/blueprints\n- At 50000 blocks: blueprints are tedious, need zoning/auto-generation\n- The toolset should grow WITH the arcology\n\n### Management Abstraction Layers\n- At small scale: manage individual blocks (this block needs light)\n- At medium scale: manage floors (floor 12 needs more corridors)\n- At large scale: manage zones/districts (the east wing has poor connectivity)\n- At mega scale: manage systems (transit system is at 80% capacity)\n- The UI needs to present information at the right abstraction level\n\n### The Tedium Cliff\n- Every city builder has a point where the player stops having fun building and starts grinding\n- In Cities Skylines: happens around 50k population when you're just filling zones\n- In Arcology: will happen when the player needs to build floor 51 and it's identical to floor 50\n- Mitigation: repeat tools, blueprints, auto-fill, template floors\n- Question: should the game auto-build some things? (Auto-extend corridors, auto-place utilities?)\n\n### Difficulty Curves\n- Sandbox mode: no pressure, build at your own pace\n- Scenario mode: specific goals at specific scales\n- The learning curve should match the scale curve — new mechanics introduced as they become relevant, not all at once\n\n## Open Questions\n1. What are the concrete tier thresholds? (Block count? Population? Height? AEI?)\n2. Should tiers be visible to the player? (\"Your arcology is now MEDIUM tier!\")\n3. Is there an explicit tutorial/advisor system, or do tools just appear when relevant?\n4. How do you handle players who want to jump straight to mega-scale? (Creative mode?)\n5. Should there be auto-build or delegation systems? (Hire an AI architect NPC?)\n6. How does the AEI (victory metric) relate to scale? Is a small, happy arcology a valid win?\n7. Does entropy scale with size? (Bigger = harder to maintain, creating natural growth limits?)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Multi-block operations (arcology-3s2) — needed for medium scale+\n- Wayfinding (arcology-s6b) — needed for medium scale+\n- Economy system (arcology-gi6) — drives medium scale tension\n- Notification system — drives large scale management\n- Overlay system (milestone 10) — drives all management scales\n- Agent simulation (milestone 7) — drives population dynamics\n\n## Reference Games\n- Cities Skylines: milestone unlocks, progressive tool access, advisor tips\n- Factorio: research tree gates tools, scale drives complexity\n- Dwarf Fortress: no progression gates, steep cliff, cult following but niche\n- SimTower: star rating system (1-5 stars) gates building types\n- Banished: population pressure drives expansion naturally","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-31T07:41:57.515411-06:00","created_by":"danielbarrett","updated_at":"2026-01-31T07:41:57.515411-06:00","labels":["game-design","user-input-needed"]}
