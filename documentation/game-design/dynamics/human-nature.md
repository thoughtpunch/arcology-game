# Human Nature

## Overview

Residents will undermine themselves and each other. This is not a bug—it's the human condition, and navigating it is the game.

---

## NIMBYism

"Not In My Back Yard"

### Dynamic

```
Every resident wants:
  - Good things near them (parks, transit, shops)
  - Bad things far from them (industrial, nightclubs, density)

When you place something "undesirable":
  - Nearby residents complain
  - Even if it's good for the arcology overall
  - Even if they themselves use it
```

### NIMBY Triggers

| Trigger | Complaint |
|---------|-----------|
| Industrial | "Not next to MY home" |
| Nightclub | "Too loud for this neighborhood" |
| Budget housing | "Will lower property values" |
| Homeless shelter | "Attracts undesirables" |
| Transit hub | "Too much traffic" |

### Gameplay Implication

You cannot please everyone. Good urban design requires hard choices. Buffer zones and gradual transitions help.

## Tribalism

### Natural Divisions Form

| Division | Basis |
|----------|-------|
| By Floor | Upper vs lower (class proxy) |
| By Zone | East wing vs west wing (territory) |
| By Tenure | Old-timers vs newcomers |
| By Type | Families vs singles (lifestyle) |
| By Class | Luxury vs budget (economic) |

### Tribal Dynamics

**In-group behavior:**
- Trust, cooperation, friendship
- Defend group members
- Share resources

**Out-group behavior:**
- Suspicion, competition
- Blame for problems
- Resist integration

### Conflict Triggers

- Shared resources (elevator allocation, parking)
- Noise across boundaries
- Perceived unfairness ("they get better maintenance")
- Status competition
- Scapegoating during crises

### Without Intervention

- Tribes calcify
- Conflicts escalate
- Segregation increases
- Community cohesion collapses

---

## Short-Term Thinking

### Residents Want Immediate Gratification

| They Want | You Need |
|-----------|----------|
| Low rent NOW | Reserves for maintenance |
| More parking NOW | Park space (long-term value) |
| No construction NOW | Expansion for future |
| No inconvenience NOW | Long-term improvements |

### Approval Dynamics

- Approval reflects short-term happiness
- Long-term investments tank approval
- Deferred maintenance is invisible until failure
- Future residents can't vote

### Leadership Tension

Sometimes being a good steward means being unpopular.

## Tragedy of the Commons

### Shared Spaces Suffer

```
Corridors: Everyone uses, no one owns → quality degrades
Community gardens: Initial enthusiasm fades → neglect
Shared amenities: Overused, under-maintained
Public spaces: Nobody's responsibility → everybody's problem
```

### Dynamic

```
Individual incentive: Use the resource, let others maintain it
Collective result: Resource degrades

Without structure: "Someone else will handle it"
Result: Nobody handles it
```

### Solutions

- Clear ownership/responsibility
- Funded maintenance for public spaces
- Community investment mechanisms
- Social pressure (reputation systems)
- Accept higher costs for shared resources

---

## Status Competition

### Humans Compare Themselves

**Upward comparison:**
- Living below someone "better off": esteem -
- Seeing neighbor's nicer apartment: dissatisfaction +
- "Keeping up with the Joneses": financial stress

**Downward comparison:**
- Living above someone "worse off": esteem +
- But also: guilt for some personalities

**Visible inequality:**
- Luxury penthouse visible from budget: resentment
- Same corridor, vastly different units: tension
- "Why do THEY get that?"

### Design Implications

- Pure meritocratic stratification creates resentment
- Mixed-income areas have tension but build community
- Hidden vs visible inequality matters
- Non-economic status helps (community respect, contribution)

---

## Game Design Response

The game should:

1. **Make NIMBY complaints visible and frequent**
   - So players understand tradeoffs
   - Learn that some complaints should be overridden

2. **Show tribal dynamics emerging naturally**
   - See need for cross-group connection
   - Experience cost of letting tribes calcify

3. **Punish short-term thinking eventually**
   - Deferred maintenance bites hard
   - Reserve funds matter
   - Long-term investments pay off

4. **Demonstrate tragedy of the commons**
   - Shared spaces degrade without investment
   - Feel the cost of neglect

5. **Surface status competition**
   - Understand inequality's social cost
   - Consider whether to segregate or integrate
